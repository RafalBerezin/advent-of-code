# Advent of Code 2024

To run the solution use: `go run main.go <day> [<part>] [-e]`.

- Day is a number between 1 and 25.
- Part is either 1 or 2. Don't specify part to run both.
- Use `-e` flag to run the solution with the example input.

(If you have the whole repository, remember to run the the command inside ./2024 directory `cd 2024`)

Examples:

- `go run main.go 2` - run day 2 solution (both parts).
- `go run main.go 5 1` - run day 5 part 1 solution.
- `go run main.go 7 2 -e` - run day 7 part 2 solution with example input.
