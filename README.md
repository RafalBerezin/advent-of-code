# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.
Each year, I plan to use a different programming language, with all code organized in the respective year's directory.

I'm starting this journey in 2024, but at some point I want to solve puzzles from previous years aswell.

## What languages have I used?

- 2024: Go

Instructions on how to run the solution are in the specific year's readme.
